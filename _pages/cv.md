* Ph.D student, Computer Application Technology, Tianjin University (TJU), Tian Jin, China, 2019 -- Present
* M,Eng., Computer Technology Engineering, Tianjin University (TJU), Tian Jin, China, 2016 -- 2019
* B.S., Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, 2012 -- 2016

Research Projects
======
* Early 2019 -- Present : Multi-Camera Video Analysis
  * Associate and track multiple humans between the top bird's eye view  and horizontal egocentric view.
  * Detect the co-interest person (CIP) via the human visual attention using complementary-view cameras.
  * Detect and recognize the human-human interactions under crowded scene using graph neural network.

* Summer 2017 -- Present : Visual Object Tracking
	* Design the dynamic/selective content-aware regularization in spatial-temporal domain for corrlation filter (CF) based visual object tracking.
	* Propose a new weighting sample based approach for CF tracking to alleviate the boundary effects.
	
* Fall 2016 -- Summer 2017 : Visual Positioning & Precision Measurement
	* Inspect the fine-grained change of cultural relics under real-world hosting environments via visual positioning and precision measurement.
	* Active recurrence of lighting condition for fine-grained change detection.
