I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Tianjin University (TJU) under the supervision of Prof. Wei Feng. I received my M.Eng from College of Interlligence and Computing, Tianjin University in 2019, supervised by Prof. Feng.
My research interests is visual intelligence, specifically including multi-camera video collaborative analysis, and visual object tracking.

I am lucky to have opportunities to work with Prof. Song Wang (University of South Carolina), Prof. Liang Wan (Tianjin University).
