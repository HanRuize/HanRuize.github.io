###Research Experience

* Early 2019 -- Present : Multi-Camera Video Analysis
  * Multiple human association and tracking (MHAT) across the top bird's eye view and horizontal egocentric view.
  * Co-interest person (CIP) identification via the human visual attention using complementary-view moving cameras.
  * Human-human interactions detection and recognition in crowded scene with wearable cameras.

* Summer 2017 -- Present : Visual Object Tracking
	* Design the dynamic/selective content-aware regularization in spatial-temporal domain for corrlation filter (CF) based visual object tracking.
	* Propose a new weighting sample based approach for CF tracking to alleviate the boundary effects.
	
* Fall 2016 -- Summer 2017 : Visual Positioning & Precision Measurement
	* Inspect the fine-grained change of cultural relics under real-world hosting environments via visual positioning and precision measurement.
	* Active recurrence of lighting condition for fine-grained change detection.
